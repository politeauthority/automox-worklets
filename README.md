# PoliteAuthority's Automox Worklets
What are Automox Worklets?
Worklets empower security and IT ops to create, automate, and enforce any custom task that they can imagine on endpoints. Based on PowerShell and Bash scripting, worklets are reusable units of work that can be applied across Windows, Linux, and macOS devices irrespective of location or domain membership.
Whatever you can script, you can turn into a Worklet. While the applications for Worklets are essentially limitless, they are particularly useful for simplifying endpoint management at scale by applying configurations to devices that don’t connect to the corporate network or aren’t in Active Directory, removing the hassle of endpoint permissions, and automating remediation of vulnerabilities that aren’t patched.
